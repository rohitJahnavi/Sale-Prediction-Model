# Sale-Prediction-Model
Q. Sales Prediction Model:
* Description: Develop a regression model to predict future sales based
on historical data. This helps in forecasting and planning for inventory,
marketing, and budgeting.
* Why: Accurate sales predictions enable better decision-making and
resource allocation.

* Tasks:
  
▪ Gather historical sales data.

▪ Preprocess data (handling missing values, encoding categorical
variables).

▪ Given datasets 

▪ Train regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest).

▪ Evaluate model performance and make predictions.

Explanation:
1. Import Libraries:

* pandas and numpy are used for data manipulation and numerical operations.

* train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

* LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor are the machine learning models used for prediction.

* mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, and r2_score are evaluation metrics to assess the models' accuracy.

* matplotlib and seaborn are for visualizations.
